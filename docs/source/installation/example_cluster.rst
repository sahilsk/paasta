Example Cluster
---------------

This folder contains a docker-compose setup for a semi-complete PaaSTA
cluster. It is intended for showing how PaaSTA works and as a
development environment for running the PaaSTA tools. It is **not** a
good example of how to setup a PaaSTA cluster in production. At Yelp we
use puppet to do that.

The environment is generally the same as the itest docker-compose
environment. However, it also includes some config files and cron jobs
that make it act more like an actual PaaSTA cluster. It also volume
mounts your working directory into the container so that you can work on
the files locally but run them in the containers.

To get started run: ``docker-compose run playground``. This should give
you a shell with the paasta\_tools package installed in development
mode. The first time this runs it will take a while because we fetch and
compile various python packages, however we store a cache on the docker
host so that it is quicker next time. If you need to update a python
package you probably want to
``pip wheel /work --wheel-dir=/var/tmp/pip_cache`` and then restart the
container.

Try it out
----------

The cluster includes a git remote and docker registry. The git remote
contains an example repo but you can add more if you want.

The mesos, marathon and chronos webuis are exposed on your docker host
on port 5050, 8080, 8081. So load them up if you want to watch. Then in
the playground container:

::

    cd /tmp
    git clone root@git:dockercloud-hello-world
    cd dockercloud-hello-world
    paasta itest -s hello-world -c `git rev-parse HEAD`
    paasta push-to-registry -s hello-world -c `git rev-parse HEAD`
    paasta mark-for-deployment --git-url root@git:dockercloud-hello-world --commit `git rev-parse HEAD` --clusterinstance testcluster.everything --service hello-world

This mimics what jenkins would do to deploy a PaaSTA service. If you end
up with some tasks that are stuck waiting it's probably because of
capacity. So add some more slaves like:
``docker-compose scale mesosslave=4``

Some but not all the command line tools should work. Try:

::

    paasta metastatus
    paasta status -s hello-world

We don't have scribe so check ``/var/logs/paasta_logs`` and syslog on
the mesosmaster for the output from cron. Also note that all the slaves
share the hosts docker daemon.

Cleanup
-------

``docker-compose down``

However note that this won't remove any containers that PaaSTA has
spawned. So to tidy up you can do something like:
``docker stop $(docker ps |grep localhost|grep paasta|awk '{print $1}')``
